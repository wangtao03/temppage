1.Strategic planning is an ongoing and unceasing process which involves defining a mission (of what a company is going to do), identifying objectives and goals ( of what is going to be achieved within a period), setting up a course of action (to implement the plan), and maintaining continuous surveillance of performance (make regular evaluations).
2.The career development field has seen tremendous change, largely because career opportunities and paths are less structured and predictable than they were two decades ago. Instead of job security and career-long tenure with one organization, downsizing and technological change now characterize the business world.
3.Mission statements are often mentioned when companies speak about their goals. Chrysler’s annual report can boast of very well-written mission statement. “Chrysler’s primary goal is to achieve consumer satisfaction. We do it through engineering excellence and superior service. And we do it as a team.”
4.Trends like globalization and technological innovation are changing the way firms are managed. Organizations today must grapple with revolutionary trends: accelerating product and technological change,globalized competition, deregulation,  and trends toward a service society and the information age.
